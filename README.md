# 🏦 Bank Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will leave the bank (churn) based on various features using different machine learning models and data balancing techniques. Multiple versions of the notebook were used to explore and compare the impact of different preprocessing, sampling, and validation strategies.

## Common Workflow in All Notebooks

- **Data Cleaning**
- **Dropped Unwanted Features**: `'RowNumber'`, `'CustomerId'`, `'Surname'` (in most files)
- **Train-Test Split** (mostly 70:30 or 80:20)
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: either using `resample()` or `SMOTE()`
- **Label Encoding & Feature Scaling**
- **Trained Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN
  - Naive Bayes
  - SVM
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - AdaBoost
- **Applied Cross Validation (mostly 5-fold)**
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** using `GridSearchCV` (for all models except Naive Bayes)
